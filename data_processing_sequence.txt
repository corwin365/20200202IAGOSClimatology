Run programmes in this order to produce the plots from the paper. Most scripts will require changes of variable path, as they are configured for my system.

Note that several postprocessing/QC steps that should logically be in iagos_cruises_st_fixedDX.m are in find_tropopause_simple.m due to the way the code evolved, and thus these must *both* be run for the dataset to be usable
